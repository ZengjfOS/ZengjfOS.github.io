# project

* pip3 install sphinx
* pip3 install sphinx-rtd-theme
* pip3 install --upgrade myst-parser
* sphinx-build --version
  ```
  sphinx-build 4.3.2
  ```
  * 如果找不到命令执行下面命令
    * sudo apt-get install sphinx-doc sphinx-common
* sphinx-quickstart docs
  ```
  Welcome to the Sphinx 4.3.2 quickstart utility.
  
  Please enter values for the following settings (just press Enter to
  accept a default value, if one is given in brackets).
  
  Selected root path: docs
  
  You have two options for placing the build directory for Sphinx output.
  Either, you use a directory "_build" within the root path, or you separate
  "source" and "build" directories within the root path.
  > Separate source and build directories (y/n) [n]: y
  
  The project name will occur in several places in the built documentation.
  > Project name: zengjf
  > Author name(s): zengjf
  > Project release []: 0.0.1
  
  If the documents are to be written in a language other than English,
  you can select a language here by its language code. Sphinx will then
  translate text that it generates into that language.
  
  For a list of supported codes, see
  https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/usage/configuration.html#confval-language.
  > Project language [en]: en
  
  Creating file /home/pi/zengjf/sphinx/docs/source/conf.py.
  Creating file /home/pi/zengjf/sphinx/docs/source/index.rst.
  Creating file /home/pi/zengjf/sphinx/docs/Makefile.
  Creating file /home/pi/zengjf/sphinx/docs/make.bat.
  
  Finished: An initial directory structure has been created.
  
  You should now populate your master file /home/pi/zengjf/sphinx/docs/source/index.rst and create other documentation
  source files. Use the Makefile to build the docs, like so:
     make builder
  where "builder" is one of the supported builders, e.g. html, latex or linkcheck.
  ```
  * 如果要兼容现在的文档格式：
    * 不用带docs目录参数
    * 不用`Separate source and build directories`
* make html
  ```
